Procedure and Steps:

To control a Samsung device using these functions, you need to modify additional command shortcuts(such as "test device on") and implement a common API shortcut called "ST_Device_CMD_API."

Command shortcut will prepare JSON data and call API shortcut to post data to desired samsung device.

Before use of API shortcut, you need to edit 'pat' field with your personal access token(ID) for the ST_Device_CMD_API, go to smartthings page for Authorization and Permissions provided by https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/getting-started/authorization-and-permissions




Tips for using command shortcuts:

1. After download, unzip the archive and tap each Shortcut to add it to the Shortcut app where you can can edit and run the Shortcut.

2. Command shortcut contains json data like [{"component": "main","capability": "switch","command":"on"}].

3. Edit "cmdJSON" field in shortcut with more controls provided in file "ST_API.json" or running ST_Query.py.

4. You need to edit "deviceid" field in shortcut with device ID provided by https://my.smartthings.com/advanced
